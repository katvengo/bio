           <p>Welcome to the first ever bio of Katelynn Vengoechea. 
            I am a budding developer. I took an interest in web development when I was really young. 
            My first foray into development was when I was about  9 or 12. I was horsing around on th website Horseland. 
            It was a website where you could purchase, train and race horses. Most "stables," could be outfitted to look really gorgeous,
            but only if you knew HTML and CSS. Today I'm going back to school after graduating with my BA in Political Science,
            to learn to be a full-stack web developer.
